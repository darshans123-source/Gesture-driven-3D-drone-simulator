# Gesture-driven-3D-drone-simulator
A real-time computer vision based drone simulator controlled entirely using hand gestures. This project uses MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and OpenCV for rendering a 3D-style drone simulation environment.  The drone responds to different hand gestures such as forward, backward, left, right, hover, and land.
